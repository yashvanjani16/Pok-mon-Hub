In this project, I built a React application that fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI using Axios. The app retrieves detailed information about 50 Pokémon and displays them as cards. I also implemented a search functionality that allows users to filter Pokémon by name. The project handles loading states, errors, and uses React hooks like useState and useEffect for state management and data fetching.
